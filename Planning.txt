Class Structure Planning

Ecosystem = Comprised of many Living Organisms

All Organisms:
Take in energy & water
Use that energy & water to live
Reproduce
Have "genes" (represented by stats) which are inherited from the parents

There are different types of organisms, such as plants and animals.

Plants:
Cannot move but can choose where to grow based on efficiency
Take in energy from the sun & water from rain and rivers / lakes
Reproduce by spreading seeds (which have a chance of being eaten by animals)

Animals:
Can move, use this to find food
Reproduce by trading genetic information with another Animal of its type
A few different types, classified based on bodies, habitat and what they eat.

Classifications:

Dietary:
Herbivore - eats plants
Granivore - eats seeds
Carnivore - eats other animals
Pescivore - eats fish
Insectivore - eats insects
Ovivore - eats eggs

Dietary options are also restricted by the size of the organism
(an eagle will not attempt to hunt an alligator)

Body Type:

Insects
Birds
Mammals
Fish
Reptiles
Amphibians

Habitat:
(All animals share the same ecosystem habitat, this specifies where they inhabit within
that ecosystem, where they make their nests, etc)

Ground
Underground (earthworms)
Hole (differs by being a large burrow)
River
Lake
Puddle
Mud
Treetops
Tree trunk
Grass
Bush
